#
# acctional_parameters is an _optional_ array of files containing additional parameters. If no array is specified, the default `dataset_parameters` file will be used. If the array contains one or more filenames (without the .toml extension), then the parameters in those files will be added to the default dataset_parameters. Parameters with the same name will override each other in the order that they're loaded, so if a file in the array contains a new version of the `row` parameter, the final set of parameters will contain the new version and not the old one. The parameters in each file are added, so if there are e.g., four parameter files specified, then all the parameters from all four files will be added to the default parameters (although overridden parameters will only be present once).
#
# Note: This file adds additional parameters to all Sentinel collections and additional parameters to all Sentinel-2 collections as a demonstration of how adding additional parameters works.
