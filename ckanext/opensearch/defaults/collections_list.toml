# description = "collection description"
# parameters_file = "name of file containing parameters for the collection _without_ the file extension"
#
# acctional_parameters is an _optional_ array of files containing additional parameters. If no array is specified, the default `dataset_parameters` file will be used. If the array contains one or more filenames (without the .toml extension), then the parameters in those files will be added to the default dataset_parameters. Parameters with the same name will override each other in the order that they're loaded, so if a file in the array contains a new version of the `row` parameter, the final set of parameters will contain the new version and not the old one. The parameters in each file are added, so if there are e.g., four parameter files specified, then all the parameters from all four files will be added to the default parameters (although overridden parameters will only be present once).
#
# Note: This file adds additional parameters to all Sentinel collections and additional parameters to all Sentinel-2 collections as a demonstration of how adding additional parameters works.

name = "NextGEOSS Sentinel-2 FAPAR"
description = "FAPAR corresponds to the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy.The FAPAR value results directly from the radiative transfer model in the canopy which is computed instantaneously. It depends on canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties and illumination conditions. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models which run at the daily time step. Consequently, the product definition should correspond to the daily integrated FAPAR value that can be approached by computation of the clear sky daily integrated FAPAR values as well as the FAPAR value computed for diffuse conditions. The SENTINEL 2 FAPAR product corresponds to the instantaneous black-sky around 10:15 which is a close approximation of the daily integrated black-sky FAPAR  value. The FAPAR refers only to the green parts of the canopy."


[NEXTGEOSS_SENTINEL2_FCOVER]
name = "NextGEOSS Sentinel-2 FCOVER"
description = "Fraction of vegetation Cover (FCOVER) corresponds to the gap fraction for nadir direction. It is used to separate vegetation and soil in energy balance processes, including temperature and evapotranspiration. It is computed from the leaf area index and other canopy structural variables and does not depend on variables such as the geometry of illumination as compared to FAPAR. For this reason, it is a very good candidate for the replacement of classical vegetation indices for the monitoring of green vegetation. Because of the linear relationship with radiometric signal, FCOVER will be only marginally scale dependent. Note that similarly to LAI and FAPAR, only the green elements will be considered, either belonging both to the overstory and understory."


[NEXTGEOSS_SENTINEL2_LAI]
name = "NextGEOSS Sentinel-2 LAI"
description = "LAI was defined by CEOS as half the developed area of the convex hull wrapping the green canopy elements per unit horizontal ground. This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations will be scale dependent over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation, it is therefore mandatory to consider all the green layers. This is particularly important for forest canopies where the understory may represent a very significant contribution to the total canopy LAI. The derived LAI corresponds therefore to the total green LAI, including the contribution of the green elements of the understory. The resulting NEXTGEOSS SENTNEL 2 LAI products are relatively consistent with the actual LAI for low LAI values and 'non-forest' surfaces; while for forests, particularly for needle leaf types, significant departures with the true LAI are expected."
