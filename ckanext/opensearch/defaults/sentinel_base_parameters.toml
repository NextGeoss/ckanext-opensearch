# Additional parameters for _all_ Sentinel collections
# NOTE: This implementation of "FamilyName" is just an example.
# Users query the FamilyName field that all Sentinel datasets have
# in the Solr index directly using Solr syntax as though it were a
# CKAN fq query. The "real" verison of FamilyName would have a different
# name and would have a standardized OpenSearch parameter and namespace
# associated with it.
#
# This is just a demo showing how to add new parameters and how mutliple
# parameter files can be combined. Since all the Sentinel datasets are
# already sorted by "FamilyName" (because all the collections currently in
# use are segmented by Sentinel-1/2/3), if the user searches for
# FamilyName="Sentinel-3" in a Sentinel-1 collection, they'll get 0 results.
# If they search for FamilyName="Sentinel-3" in a Sentinel-3 collection,
# they'll get the same results as if they'd searched without the parameter.
# In both cases, the results will be correct. Remember, this is just a demo.
