# NOTE: This implementation of cloudcoverage works,
# but it's just an example. The "real" implementation
# of cloudcoverage will depend on a standard
# like geo, eo, etc. This version just lets the user
# query the CloudCoverage field in the Solr index
# directly using Solr syntax as though it were a
# CKAN fq query.
